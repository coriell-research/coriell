#' Calculate threshold value on ranked input
#'
#' Calculate a threshold value of a vector based on the unimodal threshold method
#' described by \href{https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Paul.Rosin/resources/papers/unimodal2.pdf"}{Rosin 2001}
#' for image thresholding. Conceptually, the method attempts to draw a line from
#' the peak of the distribution to the tail and calculates the maximum distance
#' from a point to that line. The point where the distance is maximized is the
#' threshold.
#'
#' The function takes a numeric vector and ranks the values using \code{data.table::frank}.
#' with \code{ties.method = "first"}. The returned values for the threshold "x" and "y",
#' indicate the rank of the data point and the value at that rank, respectively.
#'
#' @param x numeric vector of values.
#' @param show_plot logical. default (FALSE). Show the scatter plot for the given distribution.
#' @return named vector containing "x" and "y" position of calculated threshold
#' @import data.table
#' @export
#' @examples
#' # simulate exponential counts
#' x <- (1:100)^exp(3)
#' rank_threshold(x, show = TRUE)

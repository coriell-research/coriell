#' Read in and Filter Bismark Coverage Files
#'
#' This function will read in Bismark coverage files and optionally filter for
#' coverage and feature-wise variance.
#' @details The function can optionally return a list of CpG x Sample matrices of
#' the filtered data if return_mats = TRUE. The following matrices will be
#' returned for each of the retained CpG sites: Coverage, Percent Methylation
#' (Percent), count of methylated CpGs (Methylated) and count of unmethylated
#' CpGs (Unmethylated)
#' @import data.table
#' @param files Named vector of file paths to the bismark coverage files
#' @param coverage Minimum coverage for a CpG site. Default (1)
#' @param prop_samples Proportion of samples that site must be covered to be retained. Default (1)
#' @param remove_zero_var Should zero variance features be removed after filtering for coverage? Default (FALSE)
#' @param return_mats if TRUE, return matrices of the filtered data in a list. Else, return the filtered data.table in bismark format. Default (FALSE)
#' @return Either a data.table of filtered data with additional columns for Coverage and Variance or a list of matrices of filtered data

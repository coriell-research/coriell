# coriell

This package is a collection of helper functions for common bioinformatics 
tasks. It includes plotting functions for expression data, wrappers around 
typical bioinformatics tools to ease use, some data transformation functions, 
dimensionality reduction helpers, and more. 

Check out the [package website](https://coriell-research.github.io/coriell/) 
for examples and documentation. 

I will be adding tests, however, **please test functions and let me know when 
things are broken** by either raising an issue on Github or contacting me.

## Installation

Since this package will be constantly changing be sure to install the latest 
version from Github using:

```R
# Make sure you have devtools installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install using devtools::install_github
devtools::install_github("coriell-research/coriell")
```

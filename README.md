# coriell

Helper functions for common bioinformatics tasks. If you find yourself reusing 
old code over and over, let me know and we'll create a function and put it in 
this package. Check out the [package website](https://coriell-research.github.io/coriell/) 
for examples and documentation. 

I will be adding tests, however, **please test functions and let me know when 
things are broken** by either raising an issue on Github or contacting me.

## Installation

Since this package will be constantly changing be sure to install the latest 
version from Github using:

```R
# Make sure you have devtools installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install using devtools::install_github
devtools::install_github("coriell-research/coriell")
```

\title{Perform p-value combination for sets of differential expression tests}
\usage{
meta_de(x, FUN, fdr = "FDR", lfc = "logFC", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SummarizedExperiment object containing combined differential
expression results from different studies. The SE object must contain at
least two assays, one for the P-values to combine and the other for the
effect sizes to compute (e.g. logFC).}

\item{FUN}{One of the 'parallel' functions provided by \code{metapod}. One
of "parallelBerger", "parallelFisher", "parallelHolmMin", "parallelPearson",
"parallelSimes", "parallelStouffer", or "parallelWilkinson".}

\item{fdr}{assay name in SE object containing the P-values to combine.}

\item{lfc}{assay name in the SE object containing the logFC values to combine.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to FUN. See the \code{metapod} package
for details.}
}
\value{
data.table with summary stats of the p-value combination of all
experiments. Please see the documentation in the \code{metapod} package for
more details. The returned columns, "Rep.LogFC" and "Rep.Pval" contain the
results of extracting the representative effect and P=value from all
influential tests. These are individual tests in the data that are particularly
important for calculating the combined effects.
}
\description{
This function performs p-value combination for all genes and estimates summary
statistics for average effect sizes for all experiments in the input
\code{SummarizedExperiment} object.

# Example taken from ?dfs2se()

# Define two differential expression dataset data.frames
exp1 <- data.frame(
  feature_id = c("geneA", "geneB", "geneC"),
  PValue = c(0.01, 0.5, 0.05),
  FDR = c(0.02, 0.5, 0.07),
  logFC = c(1.2, -2.5, 3.7),
  logCPM = c(12, 9, 0)
)

exp2 <- data.frame(
  feature_id = c("geneA", "geneB", "geneD"),
  PValue = c(0.07, 0.3, 0.8),
  FDR = c(0.08, 0.4, 1.0),
  logFC = c(1.5, -2.0, 3.0),
  logCPM = c(14, 10, 2)
)

# Combine into a single list
l <- list(experiment1 = exp1, experiment2 = exp2)

# Convert the data to a SummarizedExperiment
se <- dfs2se(l)

# Perform p-value combination across experiments for each gene
#  using Wilkinson's method and passing additional values
result <- meta_de(se, metapod::parallelWilkinson, min.prop = 0.1)
head(result)

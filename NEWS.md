## coriell 0.2.0

- `edger_to_df()` returns a data.frame instead of a tibble
- New functions for generating random color palettes: `distinct_rgb_palette()`
and `random_rgb_palette()`
- Function for defining threshold based on ranked data: `unimodal_threshold()`. 
Inspired by unimodal thresholding algorithm from image analysis. Function name
might change in later version to something more descriptive (i.e. `rank_threshold()`)
- `panther_go()` now returns a `data.table` of the raw, unlisted data returned from 
the request. The original version pivoted the table wider using columns for the
GO term and the description of the GO term. This result gave inaccurate results
when using a different pathway in the function call. 
- General move towards reducing the number of dependencies in functions by either
removing outside packages and switching to base R or moving to `data.table()`. 

## coriell 0.1.0

- Updated internals for `permutation_correlation_test()` that applies permuted 
vector in a vectorized fashion over the entire matrix. 
- Removed filtering capability from `edger_to_df()` to allow for any `EdgeR` 
results objects to be used as input.
